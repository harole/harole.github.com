<p>In second grade, I still didn't know how to read. I remember sitting at Sunday school and not being able to read the assignment. I tried to hide it and drew pictures instead.</p>  
<p>My parents were concerned and had me tested for learning disabilities. They even moved us to a new city. I was so far behind, it took me years to catch up. But, the school was better. In third grade, I started to read.</p> 
<p>There's something that became part of my ethos then. I was at the bottom. I had to do everything to work my way up. I remember constantly telling myself that I just needed to work harder than everyone.  I had to hustle.</p> 
<p>I became my story. I worked hard and I hustled. </p>

<p>Everyone has a story. You repeat it in your head every day. It's a story of how the world reacts to you and how you react to the world. It's a story of patterns, where things are experienced over and over again. </p>
<p>Just as it can be powerful and energizing, it can also be dangerous. If its a tragic story, you become a tragedy. </p>
<p>I remember reading East of Eden and there was a passage that I'll always remember. Cal's father, trying a new venture, lost all of his money. Cal was smart; he executed on an idea and made a lot of money. When he tried to give it to his father, his father rejected it. Cal goes to his room and burns the money, one note at a time.</p>
<p>His caretaker Lee comes in:  </p>
<p>Are you taken pleasure from this whipping you're giving yourself? Are you enjoying your despair?”</p>
<p>“Lee!”</p>
<p>“You’re pretty full of yourself. You’re marveling at the tragic spectacle of Caleb Trask—Caleb the magnificent, the unique. Caleb whose suffering should have its Homer. </p>
<p>Maybe it was easier for Cal to become a tragedy. It was easier to think that what he experienced was uniquely painful.  It was hard to think that many others have suffered, often worse than him. Unique pain has more meaning. </p>
<p>The danger is that you internalize the pain. You become someone who deserves the misfortune and can't get away from it. You expect it and it happens. </p>
<p>If your story is of success, of overcoming adversity, you become that story. As you try it, it validates itself and becomes more true. You expect it and it happens. </p>
<p>We have words for these people in the startup world: hustlers, cockroaches (which is a compliment for people and companies that refuse to die), lucky. It's the person that surprises us. It's a person that shouldn't succeed, who gets rejected and ignored, but somehow does and does it with energy. </p>
<p>When you tell yourself your story, pause and think it over. Be a force, be a hustler, be creative, be lucky, but don't be a tragedy. </p>
